      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Car Manager UI Example'),

        body: Center(
          child: PrimaryButton(
            txtLabel: 'Click Me',
            onPressed: () {
              // Your onPressed function here
            },
            isLoading: false,
            icon: const Icon(Icons.car_rental),
          ),
